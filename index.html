          <h3>Leadership Coaching Expertise</h3>
          <p>
            Walter Slade brings more than 30 years of experience in coaching,
            advising, and collaborating with business leaders, teams, and
            individuals to help them be their best while doing their best work.
            He has worked locally and globally with diverse clients in the HR,
            pharmaceuticals, manufacturing, operations, commercial, finance,
            legal, IT, supply chain, procurement, safety, engineering, high
            technology, telecommunication and non-profit.
          </p>
          <p>
            Walter’s openness, passion, and willingness to make things happen
            has helped make him a successful coach, HR professional, and leader
            in three global business industries and at all levels of an
            organization. Although he has worked in various organizational
            roles, he truly enjoys working in “hands on” assignments where he
            can be a “thinking and doing” partner.
          </p>
          <p>
            Walter is known for seeing the best and the potential in each
            individual. Like John Maxwell, he sees himself as a “lid lifter,”
            opening minds and hearts to other possibilities. This mindset is
            rooted in his childhood in Newark, New Jersey. It was there that
            Walter learned:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              To see others and himself beyond the popular negative stereotypes
              of inner-city African American youth, especially males
            </li>
            <li>
              The value of community and the importance of individual and
              collective accountability
            </li>
            <li>
              That change starts at home (self first)—and so does leadership
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Background and Training</h4>
          <p>
            Walter earned his B.A. from Drew University in New Jersey. He is a
            SHRM-Certified Senior Human Resources Professional, a Certified
            Professional Coach and a ELI Master Practitioner from the Institute
            for Professional Excellence in Coaching (IPEC). Walter also is a
            volunteer coach for the New Start Career Network, which helps New
            Jersey’s long-term unemployed job seekers.

              "Walter is a first-class Leadership and HR consultant and adviser,
              and a valued resource to our entire management team. He is able to
              seamlessly adapt to nearly any personnel situation or need that
              arises across our small business. He gives deep thought to our
              challenges and returns with insightful advice based on his many
              years of experience in the HR and Leadership space. His ability to
              coach on both a one-on-one and group setting allows us to
              constantly improve in a flexible and efficient manner."
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              "Walter played a pivotal role in helping me find the courage and
              clarity that was buried within myself during my recent career
              change. His advice, coaching and encouragement helped me a great
              deal during an extremely challenging time but the questions and
              outline that he helped me discover through our discussions was
              what I needed and ultimately helped motivate me to take a chance
              on change. For that, I am grateful and invite everyone the
              opportunity to be enlightened by him as well!"
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              "Walter has been a tremendous support in coaching pastors in
              leadership principles, organizational management, and change
              implementation. I highly recommend him both in leadership coaching
              but also in board consultation."

          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              "I’d had the pleasure of working with Walter as a career coach.
              Walter is a great listener and has a natural talent for asking
              questions that will help you to find the answers within yourself.
              Think about that, a valuable gift he offers to get you thinking
              about internal questions you’ll need to answer for yourself.
            </p>
            <p>
              Walter is a great coach to have in your corner and to bounce ideas
              off. His quote about “playing chess and not checkers” will be with
              me forever when assessing strategy for unlocking the best that I
              can be."
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            "I had the pleasure of meeting Walter as a client of Lee Hecht
            Harrison. From the moment I met Walter, I appreciated his ability to
            connect with me. He has a very empathetic and easy-going coaching
            style that puts you at ease immediately. He was able to guide me to
            make decisions and move in a positive direction. He knew the
            questions to ask and how to probe to make sure we were focusing on
            the right plan of action. I was lucky to benefit from Walter's
            expertise. I would recommend Walter to anyone looking for a coach or
            a mentor. He is outstanding!"
          </li>
          <li>
            "Walter is an outstanding coach with a wealth of experience, deep
            understanding of human interactions and how to make the most ofthose
            interactions. Walter's insight has been valuable in re-shaping my
            thinking and ability to boil down complex and emotional situations
            into simple and practical hypotheses to be tested. Walter has a way
            of connecting with people in a very genuine way that allows you to
            build trust with him and quickly seek his advice and thoughts. I
            thank him for the many situations that he has helped me navigate
            when I didn't know what to do, had doubts about my approach, or was
            just curious as to what he had to say. Walter, I thank you for your
            advice, your collaborative nature and most of all for being a good
            friend."
          </li>
          <li>
            "Walter is a rare leader who is able to think and act strategically
            to produce significant and measurable business results. He is an
            inspirational voice who can rally a large organization to common
            good and shared success. He has an incredible ability to apply his
            extensive OD capabilities (inclusion, coaching, change execution,
            etc) within an organization to help individuals and the collective
            to do their best work together. Not only is he an expert but he is a
            wonderful human being who can connect and inspire and organization."
